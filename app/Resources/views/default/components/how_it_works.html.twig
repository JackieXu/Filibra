                    have to do is sign up for a challenge and start posting stuff using the hash tag for the
                    challenge.</p>
                <p class="center text">We check your posts and assign a score to them based on itâ€™s relevance and the
                    amount of exposure your post get. The more likes / retweets / comments / etc your posts receive,
                    the higher your score.</p>
                <p class="center text">When a challenge closes, your score is compared to the scores of all other
                    players to determine your earnings.</p>
